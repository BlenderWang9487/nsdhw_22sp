DummyML

Basic Information
=================

A dummy ML library for NSD course term project.

Here is my Github page: `Github`_

Problem to Solve
================

I want to build a machine learning library based on some mathematical theories.

There are many easy-to-use hybrid frameworks that built for deep learning, 
but fewer for other algorithms. So I'm going to build one.

Some regression, classification and clustering models will be provided 
by this library.

Prospective Users

System Architecture
===================

Analyze how your system takes input, produces results, provide interface, and
performs any other operations.  Describe the system's work flow.  You may
consider to use a flow chart but it is not required.  Specify the constraints
assumed in your system.  Describe the modularization of the system.

API Description
===============

Show how your system can be programmed.  You are supposed to implement the
system using both C++ and Python.  Describe how a user writes a script in the
system.

Engineering Infrastructure
==========================

1. Using Cmake to configure & build the project
2. Using Git to control different versions
3. Using Pytest for testing
4. Documentation: I plan to just write markdown files as documentation for now.

Schedule
========

Itemize the work to do and list them in a timeline.  Estimate the efforts of
each item before the project starts.

The schedule is expected to be adjusted during the development.  A schedule to
accurately predict everything in the development is impossible and unnecessary.
But the initial estimate is important, for the baseline becomes concrete when
we adjust the plan.

To start, you can list the to-do items on a weekly basis and assume the
development of the project takes 8 weeks:

* Planning phase (6 weeks including 2/21, 2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28):
* Week 1 (4/4):
* Week 2 (4/11):
* Week 3 (4/18):
* Week 4 (4/25):
* Week 5 (5/2):
* Week 6 (5/9):
* Week 7 (5/16):
* Week 8 (5/23):
